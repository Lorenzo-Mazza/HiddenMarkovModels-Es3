# HiddenMarkovModels-Es3
In this task I had to estimate the model parameters for an HMM. I was given a starting guess of a HMM (transition matrix, emission matrix and initial state probability distribution) and a sequence of emissions and I had to train the HMM to maximize the probability of observing the given sequence of emissions.
